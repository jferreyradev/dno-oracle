## Reporting a Vulnerability 🚨

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to allow us to fix them before public disclosure.

### 2. Send a private report

- **Email**: j.ferreyra.dev@gmail.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] DNO-Oracle Vulnerability Report
- **Include**:
  - Detailed description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Suggested fix (if available)

### 3. What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depending on severity
  - Critical: 1-3 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next planned release

### 4. Disclosure Process

1. **Private Fix**: We'll work on a fix privately
2. **Testing**: Thorough testing of the fix
3. **Release**: Security patch release
4. **Public Disclosure**: After users have had time to update

## Security Best Practices 🛡️

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files
3. **Database Credentials**: Use strong, unique passwords
4. **Network Security**: Restrict database access by IP
5. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
6. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
7. **Regular Audits**: Regularly review access logs

### For Developers

1. **Code Reviews**: All code changes must be reviewed
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans
3. **Static Analysis**: Use security-focused linters
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimize database permissions
5. **Secrets Management**: Use proper secret management tools
6. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

## Common Security Considerations 🔐

### Database Security
- **Connection Strings**: Never hardcode connection strings
- **User Permissions**: Use dedicated database users with minimal privileges
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (we do this by default)
- **Connection Pooling**: Properly configure connection limits

### API Security
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication
- **Authorization**: Check permissions for each endpoint
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **CORS**: Configure CORS properly for your use case

### Environment
- **OS Updates**: Keep your operating system updated
- **Oracle Client**: Keep Oracle Instant Client updated
- **Network**: Use firewalls and secure network configurations
- **Logging**: Monitor and log security events

## Vulnerability Categories 🎯

We consider the following types of vulnerabilities:

### Critical
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- SQL Injection
- Authentication Bypass
- Privilege Escalation

### High
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service (DoS)

### Medium
- Configuration Issues
- Weak Cryptography
- Information Leakage
- Insecure Defaults

### Low
- Security Misconfiguration
- Insufficient Logging
- Error Message Information Disclosure

## Security Tools 🔧

We recommend using these tools:

- **Dependency Scanning**: `deno task check-deps`
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint with security rules
- **SAST**: SonarQube, CodeQL
- **DAST**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Secrets Scanning**: GitGuardian, TruffleHog

## Responsible Disclosure 📢

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

1. **Acknowledge** your report promptly
2. **Communicate** regularly about progress
3. **Credit** you for the discovery (if desired)
4. **Coordinate** the disclosure timeline
5. **Thank** you publicly (if appropriate)

## Bug Bounty 💰

While we don't currently have a formal bug bounty program, we greatly appreciate security researchers who help us improve DNO-Oracle's security. We may consider recognition or rewards for significant security findings.
